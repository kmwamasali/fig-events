# fig-events
## Business situation
Along with the unprecedented situation of 2020, FigEvents launched an event sourcing
application that features over 100 tech conferences that take place online. Their mission last
year was to create an online community covering a broad range of technical topics, from AI to
mobile developments, to robotics, and more. Today they are looking to expand their list of
events including face-to-face experiences available in the UK.

## Task
Your task is to present in a prototype format how you would develop a solution for them to allow
people to easily discover events that match their interests.
